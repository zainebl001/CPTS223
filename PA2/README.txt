CPTS223 PA2: Josephus Problem

1. 
Yes. A faster CPU processes eliminations and operations with more speed. This is more prevalent at larger N.

2.
Vector is performing better overall. Vector does better as the array gets to the end. Where List would do better when deleting from the middle of the list.

3.
Runtime is increased with N. This is because more eliminations and operations are required. M has a much smaller impact unless it causes many repeats.
