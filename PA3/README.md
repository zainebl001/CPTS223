CPTS223 PA3: AVL Map Performance

1.
Yes, AVL tree lookup and logarithmic insertion are supported.

2.
AVL tree uses lef and right rotation after insertion and deletions which maintin logarithmic performance.

3.
std map lookup time: 0.000772407 seconds
avl map lookup time: 0.000658971 seconds

4.
AVL map performed slightly faster than std map. With avl maps you have more control, where in std maps you have STL optimization
